# MagicTheGathering-Card-Search

Welcome to the Magic Card Search project! ðŸ§™âœ¨ This project was initially a coding assignment given to me during an interview process. I found the task interesting and decided to expand on it, turning it into a full-fledged project for display in my portfolio.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a basic full-stack application using TypeScript, React, Node, Express, and integrating with the Scryfall API for Magic cards. The project includes a backend that serves as a REST endpoint to fetch Magic cards based on a user-provided search string. The frontend, built with React, enables users to search for cards using a user-friendly interface and displays card information such as images, names, set names, numbers, and rarities.

## Features

- **Search Bar**: Users can input a card name to search, and the application will dynamically retrieve and display relevant Magic cards.
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse, users are restricted from submitting more than one API request per second using the search bar.
- **Card Display**: The application presents Magic cards in a user-friendly format, showcasing images, names, set names, numbers, and rarities.

## Bonus Features

- **Backend Testing**: The Node endpoint has been tested using a testing framework of choice.

- **Frontend Enhancement**: Added pagination and sorting features to enhance the user experience.

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: The entire interface is styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), providing a clean and responsive design.
